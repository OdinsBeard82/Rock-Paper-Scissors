# Rock-Paper-Scissors


This project is a simple implementation of the classic "rock paper scissors" game. The game is played from the browser console, and it involves the player making a choice between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer making a random choice. The winner of each round is determined based on the game rules.

## Features

- **Console-Based Gameplay**: The game is played entirely from the browser console.
  
- **User Input with prompt()**: The player's choice is obtained using the prompt() function.

- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores over a 5-round match.

- **Game Over Display**: At the end of the game, the winner or loser is reported in the console.

## Usage

1. Open the browser console.
2. Call the `game()` function to start a new 5-round match.
3. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.
